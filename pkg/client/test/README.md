# README

The SDF files come from SoftTALK 2000.
I use them here to cross-check my implementation with a known-good source, however I do believe
that SoftTALK also contains some errors in its implementation, some data that comes out of it does not make sense.

To be very clear: I did NOT de-compile or reverse-engineer SoftTALK.
I only used it to get some data to be able to determine shutter speeds, apertures etc.

The data is used in unit tests to compare output of this application with SoftTALK.
